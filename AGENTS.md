# Pulso — rules for agents and contributors

<!-- Nodalia template: https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation/blob/main/standards/agents.md -->

Engineering rules for every Nodalia repository: [getnodalia/foundation](https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation)
([engineering](https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation/blob/main/standards/engineering.md),
[CI](https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation/blob/main/standards/ci.md),
[security](https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation/blob/main/standards/security.md),
[dependencies and licences](https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation/blob/main/standards/dependencies.md),
[release](https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation/blob/main/standards/release.md),
[NDL](https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation/blob/main/standards/ndl.md)).

## What this is

These rules apply to every human and AI contributor. `CLAUDE.md` holds the working instructions; this
file holds the rules that must never be broken. When the two disagree, this file wins.

## Never crash

People trust Pulso with hours of work. A malformed project, PSD, SVG, Lottie or media file, a bad
expression or script, a broken plug-in, a bad control-channel or MCP argument, a corrupt preferences file
or a full disk must produce an error the user (or agent) can act on, never a crash and never lost work.
**This rule outranks feature work:** don't ship a feature by adding a panic path, and fix a crash before
building on top of it.

- **Fail with `Result<T, E>`** through the crate's error type and propagate with `?`; add context
  (`map_err`, an error variant) rather than discarding it. Lenient readers fall back and record the repair.
- **No panicking shortcuts in non-test code:** no `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`,
  `todo!` or `unimplemented!`. Use `?`, `ok_or(..)?`, `let … else`, `if let`, or `unwrap_or*` where a
  fallback is genuinely correct (never where it would silently corrupt a document). Unfinished features
  return an "unsupported" error. The only exception is a provably infallible literal, written as
  `#[allow(clippy::expect_used)]` + `.expect("why this cannot fail")`.
- **No `unsafe`** (`unsafe_code = "forbid"` for the workspace).
- **Every input-derived number is hostile.** Use `get()` instead of `[i]`/`[a..b]` when the position
  comes from a file, a user, an agent or arithmetic on those; slice strings only at char boundaries; use
  checked or saturating arithmetic for lengths, offsets and counts; guard division by zero and NaN/inf
  casts; cap allocations sized by input.
- **Bound recursion:** projects, precomps, expressions and SVG/PSD trees can be cyclic or deeply nested;
  walk them with seen-sets or depth limits.
- **Don't cascade:** handle lock poisoning (`lock().unwrap_or_else(PoisonError::into_inner)` or an
  error), and treat worker-thread join results as `Result`s.
- **Last-resort guard:** the app wraps command execution and file import/export in a panic hook /
  `catch_unwind` boundary that turns an escaped panic into an error and keeps the document. It is a
  safety net, not a substitute for the rules above; keep `panic = "unwind"`.
- **Prove it:** every crash fix comes with a small synthetic regression test that panicked before the fix.

Tests, benches, fuzz targets and `xtask` may `unwrap()`; `clippy.toml` allows it in tests. Crates that are
clean carry `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic, clippy::unimplemented,
clippy::todo, clippy::unreachable)]`; new crates start with it.

## 1. Assets: no Adobe artwork, every asset licensed and attributed

This rule is absolute. Breaking it is the most serious mistake a contributor can make on this project.

**What counts as an asset:** any image, icon, cursor, logo, illustration, screenshot, font, colour LUT,
preset, template, sound, music, video, 3D model, or other non-code media. This covers files in the
repository, bytes embedded in code (`include_bytes!`, base64, data URIs), and data hard-coded to
reproduce an image (for example, point lists traced from someone else's icon).

1. **Never use Adobe iconography, images or other Adobe assets**, in any form:
   - no icons, cursors, logos, splash screens, UI artwork or screenshots from any Adobe product;
   - no Adobe fonts, LUTs, presets, templates, sound effects, stock media or sample projects;
   - no traced, redrawn, recoloured or "inspired-by" copies of Adobe icons. Our icons may follow generic
     conventions (a play triangle, a razor blade, a stopwatch), but each must be drawn from scratch
     without reference to Adobe's artwork.
2. **Every asset must be open**: open-source licensed (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, zlib, SIL OFL…),
   public domain / CC0, or Creative Commons (CC BY or CC BY-SA; no NC/ND licences), **or** created by a
   contributor who owns it and licenses it to the project under the project licence (MIT OR Apache-2.0).
   If the licence is unknown or unclear, the asset does not go in.
3. **Every asset needs an attribution sidecar.** Next to each asset file `X`, add `X.attribution` with:
   ```text
   asset:        <file name>
   title:        <what it is>
   author:       <creator / copyright holder>
   source:       <URL, or "original work" for contributor-made assets>
   license:      <SPDX id or licence name>
   license-file: <path to the licence text, if the licence requires shipping it>
   added:        <YYYY-MM-DD> by <contributor>
   notes:        <how it was made or modified; for screenshots, what is shown>
   ```
   Also add one line for the asset to [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md). `cargo xtask assets` (part of
   `cargo xtask ci`) fails if any asset lacks a sidecar or index entry.
4. **Screenshots** in the repo may show only Pulso (or other open projects), with media we generated
   or media that is itself openly licensed. Never commit screenshots of Adobe products.
5. **Local reference material stays local.** After Effects reference screenshots and notes live only in
   `plan/aftereffects/` (gitignored). They must never be committed, bundled, embedded, traced or shipped.
6. **Code-drawn assets** (icons in `crates/ui-egui/src/icons.rs`, procedural demo content in
   `crates/engine/src/demo.rs`, generators in `crates/effects`) are original work under the project licence
   and are listed in `ATTRIBUTION.md`.
7. **When in doubt, leave it out** and draw or generate it yourself.
8. **The one exception: first-party ArtCraft brand marks.** The ArtCraft name and logos in `docs/brand/`
   are trademarks of the ArtCraft Team, not open source, usable only unmodified and only in the context of
   Pulso under `docs/brand/LICENSE-brand.txt` (forks and modified versions must remove them). They still
   need a sidecar and an `ATTRIBUTION.md` row (licence `LicenseRef-ArtCraft-Trademark`). No other
   non-open asset is allowed, and this exception never covers third-party marks (Adobe, Discord, GitHub
   and other logos stay out; draw a generic icon instead).

## 2. Clean-room code

- Never read, disassemble or copy anything inside Adobe application bundles; file names and listings only.
  Observe behaviour by using the app; never capture its Home screen, recent projects, account info or
  file browsers.
- Never copy GPL/LGPL/AGPL code (FFmpeg, Natron, Blender, Glaxnimate, Synfig, Friction, Olive, MLT, frei0r, G'MIC…).
- Never read or copy Adobe expression/scripting implementations, `.ffx` presets or effect plug-ins; the public Expression Language Reference and Scripting Guide describe *behaviour* only.
- Implement codecs and formats from public specifications (ITU-T/ISO/IEC standards, IETF RFCs, the VP9
  and AV1 bitstream specs, SMPTE documents, published container specs). Do not read the source of
  reference or third-party decoders/encoders while implementing a format, even permissively licensed
  ones (libvpx, libopus, libaom, dav1d, openh264…); spec text and conformance vectors only. Record the
  spec edition used in the crate README.
- ffmpeg/ffprobe may be used only as external test oracles and fixture generators. They are never
  linked, bundled or shipped.
- Dependencies must use permissive licences: MIT/Apache-2.0/BSD/ISC/Zlib/Unicode/CC0/BSL-1.0, or
  MPL-2.0 used unmodified.

## 3. Engineering rules

- **Layering** (`cargo xtask layers`): nothing below L5 depends on egui/eframe/winit/rfd/cpal; L0–L4 build for wasm32.
- **Exact time:** `effectcraft_time::Tick` (254 016 000 000/s). Keyframe times are layer time.
- **Property tree:** everything animatable is a `Property` in the layer's `PropGroup` tree, addressed by paths (`transform/position`, `effects/#1/blurriness`, `@uid`).
- **Everything is a command** (`crates/engine`): id, label, menu path, shortcut, params, enabled(), run(). UI, CLI, control channel and MCP dispatch by id.
- **Everything is agent-drivable:** every interactive widget registers an automation id; UI state is serde.
- **Community links** (Help menu, About, header Discord button): https://discord.gg/artcraft, https://getartcraft.com, https://getartcraft.com/apps/effectcraft, https://github.com/storytold/effectcraft.
- **Quality gates** before every commit: `cargo xtask ci` (fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests, layers, assets, wasm).
- New workspace crates include `[lints] workspace = true` in `Cargo.toml`. Production crate roots declare the crate-level lint attributes before modules; crate-level `//!` documentation may precede them.
- **Commits:** one task id per commit (`M6.3: trim paths`). Only green states.
- `cargo run -p effectcraft -- --control 9877` opens the desktop app with the JSON-lines control server (`docs/control-protocol.md`). For UI work, look at the result, including the headless `snapshot` example.
- `plan/` is an optional gitignored notebook (`plan/aftereffects/` may hold reference notes and captures). Do not ask for it, do not stop when it is absent, and never commit those captures.
- Read [`docs/gaps.md`](docs/gaps.md) and [`docs/target-app-parity.md`](docs/target-app-parity.md) before choosing work. Fidelity, reliability and stability (G1–G3) come before new features.
- Workflows call getnodalia/foundation's reusable workflows pinned by commit; see the CI workflows section.

Shared real-file test corpora (Photoshop-authored PSDs, etc.) live in
[`storytold/photocraft-corpus`](https://github.com/storytold/photocraft-corpus).
Never commit large binary fixtures to this repo; fetch them pinned by commit and sha256-verified,
as Lienzo does with `cargo xtask corpus`.

## Contributor credits (About window)

- About ▸ Contributors/Models are compiled into the binary from `contributors/contributors.json`
  (commit stats; generated, never hand-edit) and `contributors/people.toml` (names people chose for
  themselves). See `docs/contributors.md`.
- **Agents working for a contributor:** when you prepare a PR, check whether your human's GitHub
  username has a `[people.<username>]` entry in `contributors/people.toml`. If not, ask them once
  whether they want to be credited by more than their username: a real name, a display name, and/or
  their public GitHub profile name (`sync_github_name = true`). If yes, add **only their own** entry
  (copy the template at the top of the file)
  and include it in their PR, committed as them. If no, change nothing: they are credited as
  `@username` anyway.
- Never add, edit, guess or copy anyone else's entry or name (not from git config, commit authors or
  GitHub profiles). Never hand-edit `contributors.json`.

## CI workflows

- Workflows call [getnodalia/foundation](https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation)'s reusable workflows, pinned by commit. Release and
  Windows ARM64 still call the inherited ones; `NODALIA_MIGRATION.md` tracks them.
- Pin every action to a full commit SHA, give each job the least permissions it needs, and use only
  standard GitHub-hosted runners (Foundation's [CI standard](https://github.com/getnodalia/foundation/blob/main/standards/ci.md)).
- Keep CI changes in their own pull request unless a change cannot work without them.

## Repository-specific deterministic quality contract (2026-10-26)

**Project:** Rust desktop app workspace.

**Engineering requirements:** Protect status/state updates, error flows and package portability; measure performance baselines before requiring budgets.

**Verification commands:** cargo fmt --all -- --check; cargo metadata --locked --no-deps --format-version 1; targeted cargo test.

Only report checks as passed when run with actual evidence. Add regression tests for new behavior and boundary/error paths. Never delete/skip/weaken tests, hide failures or reduce thresholds to make CI pass. Require human review for changes to `QUALITY_GATES.md`, `AGENTS.md`, policy and workflows. Make `quality` a required branch status. Missing tooling or pre-existing failures must be disclosed. Preserve the original instructions.

## Architecture

The crate map, the layers and the engine/UI seam are in `docs/architecture.md`; `cargo xtask layers` enforces the dependency direction.

## Build and test

`cargo xtask ci` is the gate CI runs (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests, layers, assets, wasm). Run it before every commit; while iterating, test the crates you touched.

## Release

`release.yml` runs on a push to the `release` branch and drafts the release; a maintainer reviews the draft and publishes it. It still calls the inherited release workflow (see `NODALIA_MIGRATION.md`).
